# OSI Preservation Project
##About

The goal of this project is to preserve the OSI designs, to recreate the authentic experience of hacking OSI hardware,
and also to help OSI owners restore, repair, or reconfigure their machines while keeping the machines as true to the original
feel as possible.

## Scans
Many of these boards were scanned by Mile High Test (http://www.mhtest.com/), now part of Gardien (http://na.gardien.com/). The gerbers
returned from the scanning process were processed as follows:
1.	Imported to Altium PCB format
2.	Borders removed from each layer, and placed on a separate mechanical layer, used to generate a separate board outline gerber.
3.	Replaced the scanner-generated stroke fonts with a closer approximation to original fonts (Arial/Arial Bold) 
4.	Text was added: "OSI preservation project / http://glitchwrks.com/osi / http://osiweb.org "
5.	Added drill table
6.	Design Rule check performed, and new Gerber and drill files generated, with optional solder masks.
7.	Solder mask files are generated for top and bottom layers.  These can optionally be used.  Some boards came with solder mask on the bottom 
layer, and many were prepared with no solder mask--especially earlier boards.
8.	README (read.me) file for PCB fab included.

## Manual reproductions
Several
were meticulously recreated by hand by Grant (Klyball).  These were created by hand in a PCB program, based on scans of the original boards,
and are startlingly close to the originals a tour de force
