## Synopsis

Ohio Scientific was one of the early makers of home computers, from the mid 70's to the mid 80's.  It's user base was small back then, and now a small number of hobbyists still hold some affection for these machines.  OSI hobbyists tend to appreciate the large, sparsely populated boards, which were easy to understand and hack.

This project aims preserve the designs by archiving the boards as quality gerbers, so that almost any OSI system can be reproduced.  Some boards have been scanned and post-processed.  Others have been recreated by hand.  This is a community project and any contributions are welcome.
